Resource.png contains plots for Z(u,w) for fixed w. wickets_in_hand__w.png contains scatter plot of observed data and plot of a curve predicted by our model when the number of wickets remaining is w. While fitting Z(u,w) to the observed data if for (u,w) = (u0,w0) there are less than 30 data points, we ignore the data collected for (u0,w0).
